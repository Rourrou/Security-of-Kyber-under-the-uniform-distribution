https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1979

Section 3. Kyber hardness
1. compute the hardness of Kyber and its variant under the uniform distribution.

    set the distr parameter in MLWE_security with "binomial" or "uniform".

    run Kyber_hardness.py.

Section 4. Decryption failure attack
1. compute the decryption failure probability of Kyber and its variant under the uniform distribution.

    run Kyber_failure.py
2. collecting the failures
   
3. Identify the sign and position of failure

    run
